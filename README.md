# CMPUT302-Bias-Report-System

**Bias Reporting Software**

- Bias can be defined as prejudice in favor of or against one thing, person, or group compared with another, usually in a way considered to be unfair. Bias can be both individual, such as one person being biased against a certain group, or it can be institutional. Institutional bias, also known as systemic bias, can be defined as a tendency for the procedures and practices of particular institutions to operate in ways which result in certain social groups being advantaged or favoured and others being disadvantaged or devalued. Your task is to design the user interface of a web application that helps students report instances of both individual bias and systemic bias that are part of their university experience.

**There are two main user types:**
- **Reporter:** This is the person making a report on experienced or observed bias. For example, this could be a student, a teaching assistant, or a professor.
- **Recipient of the report:** This is the person receiving reports of experiences affected by bias, in order to act on them. For example, this could be someone like a department chair or a dean. 

**The reporter should have the ability to:** 
- Create new reports. Reports should have a field to enter a detailed description of the incident that occurred.
- Save the report as a draft without submitting it.
- View a list of their draft reports.
- Edit a draft report.
- Delete a draft report.
- Submit a report. Reporters should be able to choose whether or not to submit anonymously.
- View a list of reports that they have submitted.

**The recipient should be able to:**
- View a list of all the reports submitted to them.
- View details of each report including the name of the person who submitted the report, the date and time the report was submitted, and the description of the incident being    reported. 
- Mark reports they have received as “Not Started”, “In Progress” or “Complete” in order to help them track their progress with the reports. 
- Both user types should be able to:
- Create an account. Both user types should only be able to create an account using their school email address.
- Log in and log out.
